<p>A Little bit about myself,

<p>I have always had an interest in building things and how things work, as phones and even tv's have become smarter i would always wonder how
<p>they work . I would like to be one of those guys that can develope the next big thing , that can help everyone every day.

<p>A friend of mine worked for coles in the IT department and would travel around Australia each week fixing their problems.

<p>I thought i would love a job like that, so that has inspired me into taking the first steps of becoming an IT specialist.

<p>I have no prior knowledge of IT except installing / uninstalling programs on my computer.

<p>I chose to be enrolled at RMIT as i did some research and found that RMIT have the courses that i need to gain knowledge in the IT industry.

<p>What i expect to learn from my subjects , is how the IT industry works and what i can do to better my life working in the field of IT.
<p>I am also enrolled in a programing course so both go hand in hand to better my working career.

<p>Going by the results of the Myers Briggs test i am more of a defender, which i find is true.  i will always defend a person if i find that they are correct.
<p>As to my Social Skills it seems that i am more of a recluse and i tend to keep to myself quite a bit, even though i have been in leadership rolls before.
<p>I seem to learn more by visual rather than reading or listening to other people who are teaching the subject, that one thing i will be working on.
<p>When forming a team i will need to find someone who can take the lead roll until i can open up a bit to ask questions, it does not take me long to start talking.</P>
